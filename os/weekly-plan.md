## Autoregulation Rules

Use these overrides anytime:

- **Joint irritation:** Swap lunges → wall sits
- **Poor sleep:** Skip cold plunge next day
- **Mental fatigue / irritability:** Reduce Wim Hof rounds
- **High work stress:** Downgrade volume, keep habit

---

## Monthly Deload Rule

Every **4th week**:
- Reduce all strength volume by **20–30%**
- Keep the same weekly structure
- Maintain breathing and mobility

---

## Success Criteria

This plan is working if:
- You train daily without pain
- Sleep quality is stable or improving
- Energy is consistent through the workday
- Motivation stays neutral (no hype required)

If motivation becomes the driver, volume is too high.

**Reminder:**  
> Consistency beats intensity.  
> Systems beat motivation.
