# personal-operating-system

> Current version: **v0.1.0**

A simple, durable system for running my day with high consistency:
- **AM Build**: breathing, strength work, cold exposure, and a calm transition into work
- **PM Restore**: mobility and downshifting for recovery + sleep quality
- **Weekly modulation**: intensity waves to avoid burnout and overuse injuries

This repo is designed to be practical, printable, and easy to iterate.

## How I use it

### Daily
- Run the **Morning (AM Build)** block
- Run the **Evening (PM Restore)** block
- If I’m stressed, sore, or underslept: **keep the habit, reduce intensity**

### Weekly
- **Mon + Fri**: full days
- **Wed**: recovery bias
- **Sat**: active recovery
- **Sun**: reset

### Monthly
- Every 4th week: **reduce volume 20–30%** while keeping the structure.

## Principles

1. **Never break the habit — only adjust intensity.**
2. **Control > chaos**: slow reps, nasal breathing, no ego.
3. **Restore daily**: mobility in the evening to undo driving/desk posture.
4. **Sustainable > heroic**: consistency beats occasional maximal effort.

## Versioning

- **MAJOR**: big redesign of the system (structure/rules)
- **MINOR**: new routines or meaningful upgrades
- **PATCH**: typo fixes, small clarifications
